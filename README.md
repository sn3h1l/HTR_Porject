## Introduction

This project aims to develop a robust handwriting recognition system capable of converting handwritten text images into machine-readable text. The system leverages a combination of CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for sequence modeling, optimized using the CTC loss function.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Convolutional Layers (CNN):** Used for feature extraction from input images.
- **Max Pooling Layers:** Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Dense Layer:** Connects the CNN output to the RNN input.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layers (RNN):** Capture dependencies in the character sequences from both directions.
- **CTC Layer:** Used for aligning the predicted sequences with the actual sequences without requiring pre-segmented training data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation includes images of handwritten text along with their corresponding transcriptions. The images are preprocessed to standardize their size and format before being fed into the model.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the CTC loss function, which is well-suited for sequence-to-sequence problems where the alignment between input and output sequences is unknown. The training process involves:

1. Preprocessing the input images.
2. Feeding the images into the CNN to extract features.
3. Passing the features through the RNN to capture sequence information.
4. Using the CTC layer to compute the loss and optimize the model parameters.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correctly predicted characters.
- **Precision and Recall:** Assess the model's performance in recognizing characters.
- **F1-Score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER):** Specific metrics for sequence prediction tasks.

## Results

The evaluation results are as follows:

- **Mean Precision:** 73.74%
- **Mean Recall:** 70.12%
- **F1-Score:** 71.88%

These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in recognizing handwritten text.

## Inference

To recognize text from new images, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the input images similarly to the training data.
2. Use the trained model to predict character sequences.
3. Apply a decoding algorithm to convert the predicted probability distributions into readable text.
4. Perform post-processing steps such as spell-checking and text normalization.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include:

- Enhancing the model architecture with advanced neural network layers.
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse handwriting styles.
- Implementing real-time handwriting recognition.
